Angular Boiler Plate Application

I created this based on recent work with Angular JS, and I really didn't like the way the Angular Seed project is set up. I decided to create my own boilerplate for creating new Angular applications using a structure and patterns I think work very well.

I decided to open source it and get some feedback from others to try an improve it.
